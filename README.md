My website, made with Gatsby and Typescript. Very WIP, it's not even online yet!

The code is currently largely based on [e-nichols](https://github.com/e-nichols)'s [repo](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume) which built a responsive resume on top of Gatsby Starter while adding TypeScript.

He also has a very nice [tutorial](http://etnichols.com/tutorials/resume-with-react-and-tsx) describing the process.

### To do

- Add React Testing Library
- Use TDD for all features going forward
- Add landing page chatter
- Better style
