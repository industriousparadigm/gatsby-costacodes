My humble website, made with Gatsby, using Markdown, and some basic Typescript.

The resume part is largely based on [e-nichols](https://github.com/e-nichols)'s [repo](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume) which built a responsive TS resume on top of Gatsby Starter. He also has a very nice [tutorial](http://etnichols.com/tutorials/resume-with-react-and-tsx) describing the process.
